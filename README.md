# What is this?
This code is for the cross-section measurement of single-top quark processes.


## The Analysis Codes folder contains the following files-
SingleTopAna.C -> The main C script <br>
SingleTopAna.h -> The associated header file <be>
ana.C <br>


**What does it do? How do I run?**

These two are the core of the entire framework. The templates for these files are generated by running MakeSelector() for the Events tree from the nanoAOD files. The header file contains the class named AnaScript, and the C file utilizes its features event by event. Before running the codes, the setup needs to be compiled into a library and it has to be loaded in the ROOT prompt.

**How do I run this on root?** <br>
To compile the code
> [] .L SingleTopAna.C+

To run the code over the various samples
> [] .x ana.C()
